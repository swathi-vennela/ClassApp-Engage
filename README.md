2. Each question is compulsory to be attempted

The response sheet of this submission will show up on this student's dashboard as well as the teacher's dashboard (the teacher who has hosted this quiz).
<b>Once a student attempts a quiz, he will not be able to take the same quiz again, an alert message saying that he has already attempted the quiz pops up.</b>
